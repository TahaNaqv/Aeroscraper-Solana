# Aerospacer Protocol - Replit Development Environment

## 📋 Project Overview

**Type**: Solana Blockchain Smart Contract Development  
**Framework**: Anchor v0.28.0  
**Language**: Rust + TypeScript  
**Completion**: 98% (Core protocols implemented)

This is a decentralized lending protocol (DeFi) built on Solana with three main smart contract programs:

1. **aerospacer-protocol** - Core lending logic (CDPs, stablecoin minting, liquidation)
2. **aerospacer-oracle** - Price feed management (Pyth Network integration)
3. **aerospacer-fees** - Fee distribution and economic model

## 🛠️ Environment Setup Status

### ✅ Installed Tools
- **Rust**: v1.88.0 with Cargo
- **Solana CLI**: v1.18.26
- **Anchor CLI**: v0.28.0
- **Node.js & npm**: Latest with TypeScript dependencies

### ⚙️ Build Requirements

This project requires building Solana BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) programs, which involves:
- Solana platform-tools (BPF toolchain)
- Extended compilation time (5-10 minutes)
- Specific system permissions

## 🚀 Development Workflow

### Option 1: Build & Test Locally (Recommended)

Due to Replit environment constraints, the recommended approach is to:

1. **Build the programs**:
   ```bash
   anchor build
   ```
   *Note: First build may take 5-10 minutes and requires platform-tools installation*

2. **Run tests**:
   ```bash
   anchor test
   ```

3. **Deploy to devnet**:
   ```bash
   anchor deploy --provider.cluster devnet
   ```

### Option 2: Direct Cargo Build

If Anchor build encounters permission issues, you can try:

```bash
cargo build-sbf
```

### Option 3: Use Pre-built Artifacts

If you have build artifacts from another environment, place them in:
- `target/deploy/*.so` - Compiled programs
- `target/idl/*.json` - Interface definitions

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes comprehensive test coverage:

```bash
# Run all tests
anchor test

# Run specific test file
npx ts-mocha -p ./tsconfig.json -t 1000000 'tests/aerospacer-solana.ts'

# Run with verbose output
anchor test --verbose
```

### Test Files Overview
- `aerospacer-solana.ts` - Main protocol tests
- `oracle-*.ts` - Oracle functionality tests
- `fee-contract-*.ts` - Fee distribution tests
- `protocol-core.ts` - Core protocol tests
- `devnet-initialization.ts` - Devnet deployment

## 🔧 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Permission Denied During Build

**Cause**: Solana platform-tools installation requires specific permissions  
**Solution**: The Solana CLI from the nix package should include BPF tools. If issues persist, try:
```bash
# Check if BPF tools are available
cargo build-sbf --version
```

### Issue: Build Timeouts

**Cause**: Solana programs take 5-10 minutes to compile initially  
**Solution**: Be patient on first build, subsequent builds use caching

### Issue: Anchor Version Mismatch

**Cause**: Multiple Anchor versions installed  
**Solution**: This environment uses Anchor CLI v0.28.0 to match `Anchor.toml`

## 📝 User Preferences

*This section will be updated as you work with the project*

## 🗓️ Recent Changes

**2025-10-08**: Initial Replit environment setup
- Installed Rust, Solana CLI, and Anchor framework
- Configured development environment
- Created setup documentation

## 🚦 Next Steps

1. **Build the programs**: Run `anchor build` (allow 5-10 minutes for first build)
2. **Run tests**: Execute `anchor test` to verify implementation
3. **Review code**: Explore the three main programs in `programs/` directory
4. **Deploy to devnet**: Use `anchor deploy --provider.cluster devnet` for testing

## 💡 Tips for Development

- **Fast feedback**: Use `cargo check` for quick syntax validation without full compilation
- **Incremental builds**: After first build, changes compile much faster
- **Test individual functions**: Focus on specific test files during development
- **Use Solana devnet**: Test deployments on devnet before mainnet

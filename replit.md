# Aerospacer Protocol - Replit Development Environment

## Overview
The Aerospacer Protocol is a decentralized lending platform on Solana, enabling Collateralized Debt Positions (CDPs), stablecoin (aUSD) minting, and an automated liquidation system. It integrates Pyth Network for price feeds and features a robust fee distribution mechanism. The project aims to provide a secure and efficient on-chain lending solution within the Solana ecosystem, offering a new primitive for decentralized finance.

## System Architecture

**Core Programs:**
The project consists of three primary Solana smart contract programs built with Anchor v0.28.0 in Rust:
1.  **aerospacer-protocol**: Manages core lending logic, including CDPs, stablecoin minting, and liquidation.
2.  **aerospacer-oracle**: Handles price feed management, primarily integrating with the Pyth Network.
3.  **aerospacer-fees**: Manages fee collection and distribution.

**UI/UX Decisions:**
The design supports transparent and auditable on-chain interactions, with all state changes and operations publicly verifiable on the Solana blockchain.

**Technical Implementations & Feature Specifications:**
*   **Collateralized Debt Positions (CDPs)**: Users can lock collateral to mint aUSD stablecoins.
*   **Stablecoin (aUSD) Minting**: Supports the minting of its native stablecoin, aUSD.
*   **Automated Liquidation System**: Ensures protocol solvency by liquidating undercollateralized positions.
*   **Stability Pool with Snapshot-Based Distribution**: Implements Liquity's Product-Sum algorithm for fair and exploit-resistant reward distribution.
*   **Fee Distribution Mechanism**: A dual-mode system that distributes fees to either the stability pool or 50/50 to specified fee addresses.
*   **Oracle Integration**: Utilizes Pyth Network for real-time price feeds for all collateral assets, with dynamic collateral discovery via CPI.
*   **Cross-Program Communication (CPI)**: Extensive use of CPI for secure and atomic interactions between sub-programs.
*   **SPL Token Integration**: Full support for Solana Program Library (SPL) tokens for collateral and stablecoin operations.
*   **Sorted Troves**: Implemented as a doubly-linked list for efficient management of CDPs, supporting ICR-based positioning and auto-discovery of liquidatable troves.
*   **Individual Collateral Ratio (ICR)**: Comprehensive, real-time ICR calculations are implemented across the protocol, supporting multi-collateral types and ensuring solvency checks.
*   **Redemption System**: Integrates with the sorted troves list, supporting both full and partial redemptions.

**System Design Choices:**
*   **Anchor Framework**: Used for Solana smart contract development.
*   **Rust & TypeScript**: Rust for on-chain programs and TypeScript for off-chain tests and interactions.
*   **Modular Architecture**: Separation of concerns into distinct programs (`protocol`, `oracle`, `fees`).
*   **Security Features**: Includes safe math operations, access control, input validation, atomic state consistency, PDA validation, and optimized for Solana BPF stack limits.
*   **Two-Instruction Architecture for Liquidation**: Separates data traversal from execution to optimize account ordering.
*   **Vault Signing Architecture**: All PDA vault authorities correctly sign CPIs using `invoke_signed`.
*   **BPF Stack Optimization**: Use of `UncheckedAccount` pattern to mitigate Solana BPF stack limits during account deserialization.

## External Dependencies
